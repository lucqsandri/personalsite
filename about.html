            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Lucas, and I'm a 19-year-old student originally from Brazil. I’ve lived in Michigan since
                2016.
                Growing up, I fell in love with soccer and volleyball, it’s my favorite sporst and something I play
                whenever I get the chance. </p>

            <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
            <p>I’m a fitness enthusiast and enjoy spending time at the gym. When I’m not active, I love relaxing with a
                good movie or binge-watching an exciting series.
                I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, exploring new places, and having fun.</p>
            <p>If I had to pick a favorite movie, it would probably be Inception, I’m a fan of movies that make you
                think.</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Even though I’ve lived in Michigan for years, I still can’t get used to the winters, they’re nothing like
                Brazil’s warm weather!</p>
